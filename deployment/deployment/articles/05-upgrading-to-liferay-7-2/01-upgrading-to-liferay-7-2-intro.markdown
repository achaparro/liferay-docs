# Upgrading to Liferay 7.2 

TODO

Here's a high level outline of the upgrade:

1. Plan for handling the deprecated applications you use.  

2. Test upgrading a @product@ backup copy

3. Prepare to upgrade the @product@ database 

5. Prepare a new @product@ server 

Plan for handling deprecated applications now.
