# Migrating a @product@ Database [](id=migrating-a-liferay-database)

If you want to use a database vendor other than the one you're using, 
you must migrate your @product@ data from its current database to the new one.
The target database vendor may provide or suggest data migration tools. If no
such tools are available or if the tools are too expensive, you can migrate the
data manually. Here are the data migration approaches:
